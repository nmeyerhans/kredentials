.SH NAME
kredentials \- KDE system tray applet to monitor and update authentication 
tokens
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Kredentials monitors the state of the user's Kerberos and AFS
authentication tokens.
.
It renews Kerberos tickets every hour up to the maximum renewable
lifetime of the tickets and informs the user when the renewable
lifetime is reached.
.
Each time Kerberos tickets are obtained, aklog(1) is run to obtain new
AFS tokens.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-i|--inform
Inform the user via a KDE "passive dialog" each time tickets are renewed.
.SH BUGS
There needs to be an option to disable the running of aklog(1) in the
event that a user is using this tool on a system that does not support
AFS.
.
The user should be able to obtain new tickets directly through
Kredentials rather than manually running kinit in a shell.
.
There should be more configurability.
